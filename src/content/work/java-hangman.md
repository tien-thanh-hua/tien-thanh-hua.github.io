This is a simple Hangman game written in Java, made as a school assignment.

Everybody remembers that classic Hangman game they used to play in school. But of course, as classic as it was, it was also very basic. Too basic compared to modern standards.

I wanted to make it better.

My implementation of the game would have multiple difficulties, a high score system and random topic system.

With such requirements, it would be easier to get a framework and build the game that way. But I decided to code it from scratch, using Java 8 (JDK 1.8) and NetBeans 8.2 IDE.

That being said, I did use Java Swing toolkit to make things easier, and the game was completed within 2 weeks.
